# StudentDelegatesAppFinal
An Android application which helps the student leadership team get transparent feedback

Purpose:
I created this Android Application to help students in my school give transparent feedback 
on a variety of aspects relating to student life. The students would be able to complete surveys and the 
data from the surveys would be first stored in a database and then later compiled to an excel document for
the student leadership team to analyse and use as evidence when proposing changes.
